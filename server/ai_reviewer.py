- **Stats**: +{metadata['additions']} additions, -{metadata['deletions']} deletions across {metadata['changed_files']} file(s)

### Code Changes (Unified Diff)
{diff_context}

### Your Instructions
1. Review EVERY file change carefully for:
   - Logical errors, incorrect CSS/JS behavior
   - Accessibility issues (missing focus states, contrast, etc.)
   - Responsiveness problems
   - Security concerns
   - Best practice violations
   - Merge conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
2. Each comment MUST be at least 10 words long with a clear explanation.
3. Do NOT hallucinate issues. If the code looks correct, say so.
4. Use severity levels: "error" (bugs/breaking), "warning" (potential issues), "info" (suggestions).
5. At the end, give an overall_verdict: "approve" or "request_changes" with a reason.

Output ONLY this JSON structure:
{{
  "comments": [
    {{
      "file": "filename",
      "severity": "error" | "warning" | "info",
      "comment": "Detailed explanation of the issue (minimum 10 words).",
